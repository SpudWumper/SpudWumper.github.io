<!-- opens up to a menu, lets user choose how big the grid is
 maybe also let them choose how difficult, i.e. how many lives/fails they have before game over
 will have a button that has a callback to:
  change text to instructions for game, display lives
  create grid and display it 
  end button if user wants to end early/go back to choose difficulty/grid size
 if user loses all lives/wins, freeze the grid/make it un-interactable
 and then display appropiate message
 and display a replay button to send them back to grid size/diff. selection
 
 could do some simple animations when we're replacing text, or creating grid, etc-->
